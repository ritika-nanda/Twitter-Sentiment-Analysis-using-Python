# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is the process of using Python to understand the emotions or opinions expressed in tweets automatically. By analyzing the text we can classify tweets as positive, negative or neutral. This helps businesses and researchers track public mood, brand reputation or reactions to events in real time. Python libraries like TextBlob, Tweepy and NLTK make it easy to collect tweets, process the text and perform sentiment analysis efficiently.

How is Twitter Sentiment Analysis Useful?
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is important because it helps people and businesses understand what the public thinks in real time.
Millions of tweets are posted every day, sharing opinions about brands, products, events or social issues. By analyzing this huge stream of data, companies can measure customer satisfaction, spot trends early, handle negative feedback quickly and make better decisions based on how people actually feel.
Itâ€™s also useful for researchers and governments to monitor public mood during elections, crises or big events as it turns raw tweets into valuable insights.
